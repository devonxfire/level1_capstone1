# Hyperion Development - Software Engineering Course
## Level 1 - Capstone Project 1

### Overview of this Task

This task focused on variables and control structures. The requirements for this task was to create a program that would allow users to calculate the interest on their investment, or to calculate the amount that should be repaid on their home loan per month.

### Terminology

Some basic financial terminolgy and calculations were introduced, which would be needed to be integrated into the program, such as:

* Simple Interest
* Principal Amount
* Compound Interest
* Accumulated Amount

### Development

The program was coded in python. The user was required to input whether they wanted to calculate an investment, or a bond.

#### The Investment Calculator

The steps that were initiated after the user selected 'Investment' were:

1. How much money they were going to deposit
2. What is the interest rate
3. How many years they plan to invest
4. Whether they want to use the 'simple' or 'compound' interest rate calculation

Their total investment was then printed out to them based on their selections

#### The Bond Calculator

The steps that were initiated after the user selected 'Investment' were:

1. What is the present value of the house
2. What is the interest rate
3. How many months do they plan to pay off the bond

Their total monthly cost of the bond was then calculated and printed out

### Summary

A good introduction to the concepts of variables, control structures and financial calculations. A 100% grade for this project was achieved :)
